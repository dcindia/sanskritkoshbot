# sanskritkoshbot

Getting a new app or visiting a new website just to know meaning of a sanskrit could be awful 😒. So, here we developed a bot for telegram that, we believe, could bring some convinience to you, at whichever level you are.


## Features
- Can be used for both sanskrit ➡️ english ➡️ sanskrit again.
- 7 popular dictionaries available
- Meanings directly in personal chats/groups, without even sending any message to bot
- Dynamically shows messages from all available dictionaries, in a single message.
- Available on all platforms Web, Linux, Android, Windows, iOS/Mac (thanks to [telegram.org](telegram.org))

## Available Dictionaries
- Monier williams
- Spoken Sanskrit
- Shabda Sagara
- Wilson
- Apte
- Yates
- Hindi (related)

## Thanks to
- All data for showing meanings are fetched from [kosha.sanskrit.today](kosha.sanskrit.today), so mine work is just minor one 😅
- [Cologne Digital Sanskrit Dictionaries](https://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/) for their overall contribution to sanskrit
- Shiv 🔱
